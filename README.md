Some Basic Image processing codes for:
- Adding salt and pepper noise
- Removing noise using:
  * Average filter:
       - fspetial built in average
       - 3*3 manual kernel
  * Median filter
  * Gaussian filter
  * rank filter (ordfilt2)
- Edge detection:
       - sobel
       - canny
       - unsharp masking
- Global Threshold
- Adaptive threshold
